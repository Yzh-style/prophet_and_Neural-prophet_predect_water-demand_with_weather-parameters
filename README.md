Prophet and Neural-prophet model are set to predect water demand based on weather parameters

the performance of two models are displayed and compared with and without taking the weather-parameters into account. In addition, how weather parameters (humidity, sun duration, rainfall, temperature) effects the water demand is analyzed.

The results showed that neural prophet model has better accuracy when forecasting the water demand. No_rain_duration and Sun_duration_accumulation have a stronger effect than rainfall and Sun_duration per hour on water demand. Sun_duration_accumulation parameter has a direct influence on the occurrence of peak water demand, and it exhibit a style of hysteresis effect.
